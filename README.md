## üñºÔ∏è Project Design - Notes

The graphic design did not include a view for the mobile or tablet version, nor did it show how the different states of the interactive elements, e.g. button, link, etc., should look. 

Therefore, I tried to take the initiative and show how they should look in my opinion.

In addition to this, I also changed a few elements that I thought could look a bit better, e.g. I added a border radius to the images to match the style of the button.


## üìò Use of BEMIT - Notes

As I have used the BEM methodology for naming the CSS classes before, it should be used correctly across the project.

However, ITCSS is a new concept to me. Therefore, I have attempted to use it but a few times I was not sure if I adhered correctly to the mentioned CSS architecture.


## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

The website is created by using the following stack:

| Technology | Description                                | Link ‚ÜòÔ∏è |
